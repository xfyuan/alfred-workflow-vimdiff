# VimDiff for Alfred 3

forked https://github.com/monkeycz/alfred-fastdiff, I removed iterm and filemerge support because I just want to use only vimdiff. I also changed the hotkey to use '/' replace '\'.

The default hotkey is `ï£¿ + /`.

* Step 1, Select a file or text segment then press the hotkey.
* Step 2, Select another file or text segment then press the hotkey.

Well, the vimdiff will be launched in a full screen of Terminal and diff your selected.
